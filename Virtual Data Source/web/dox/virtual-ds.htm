<p>The Virtual Data Source is a data source without any connection to an external or physical system. It exists entirely within the system's own memory space. The data it produces is either random, or deterministic depending on how you configure the points.</p>

<p>
  Virtual data sources can be useful in a number of ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A simple way to validate that your system is working</li>
  <li>It can create predictable data with which to benchmark your real data</li>
  <li>You can control equipment in more complex ways. For example, if your home lighting is controlled by the system, you could use a random binary point to turn the lights off and on while you are on vacation, creating the impression that you are still home.</li>
  <li>Anywhere where deterministic or random data is useful</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The data source configuration is simple. It requires only a name, and setting the polling configuration.
</p>

<h2>Polling Configuration</h2>
<p>
 <b>Quantize</b> will cause the data source startup to be delayed
  so that pollings occur at a "rounded" point in time (e.g. if polling is every 10 seconds, polls will occur on the 10th 
  second, the 20th second, etc). Otherwise, polling will begin immediately.  While using quantized polls <b>Cron pattern</b> is not an option.
  <br></br>
  <b>Update periods</b> define the period at which the poll will occur. For example, if you choose "2 minutes", then every two minutes 
  the algorithms that change the virtual point values for that data source will be run.<br></br>
  <b>Cron pattern</b> is optional but when set will disable the <b>Update period</b> setting.  Cron patterns can be used to schedule the data source to run
  at flexible intervals.
