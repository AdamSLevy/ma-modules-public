<h1>CORS Support</h1>
<p>The API is designed to work with Cross Origin Sharing but the filter must be enabled first.  
To enable the filter you must create a file named {MA_HOME}/overrides/web/override-web.xml and restart Mango.  
An example file is located here: <a href="/modules/mangoApi/web/dox/web-override.xml" target="_blank">/modules/mangoApi/web/dox/web-override.xml</a>
</p> 


<p>Then you can either modify the name/value pairs in the classes/mangoApiHeaders.properties file or make the changes on the System Settings page.  
Note that changes can be made while mango is running and will be picked up immediately.</p>
