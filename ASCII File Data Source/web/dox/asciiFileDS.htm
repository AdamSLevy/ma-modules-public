<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
  This data source reads a file as an ASCII character stream on a line by line basis.
</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
  Every data source requires a <b>Name</b>, which can be any description, and an <b>XID</b>, which must be unique among
  all data sources. The polling configuration specifies how frequently the data source checks the file. The <b>File Path</b>
  points to the file you want to access information from. The file path is absolute, but networked paths are not supported.
  Use the "Check" button to verify your file path references an existing file. 
</p>
<h2>Polling Configuration</h2>
<p>
 <b>Quantize</b> will cause the data source startup to be delayed
  so that pollings occur at a "rounded" point in time (e.g. if polling is every 10 seconds, polls will occur on the 10th 
  second, the 20th second, etc). Otherwise, polling will begin immediately.  While using quantized polls <b>Cron pattern</b> is not an option.
  <br></br>
  <b>Update periods</b> define the period at which the poll will occur. For example, if you choose "2 minutes", then every two minutes 
  the algorithms that change the virtual point values for that data source will be run.<br></br>
  <b>Cron pattern</b> is optional but when set will disable the <b>Update period</b> setting.  Cron patterns can be used to schedule the data source to run
  at flexible intervals.
