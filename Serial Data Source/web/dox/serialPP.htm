<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The <b>data type</b> governs how to interpret the data. Current parsing
is done with the Integer, Double, and Boolean parse functions. The <b>point 
identifier</b> is used if a terminator is being used to match the <i>message index</i>
group as matched by the <i>message regex</i>, which determines if the <b>value regex</b>
should be applied. If a match is found, the group at <b>value index</b> is sent to the parser.</p>
<p>If no terminator is being used, the <b>value regex</b> is applied judiciously and, upon 
finding a match, the group at <b>value index</b> is sent to parsing.</p>
