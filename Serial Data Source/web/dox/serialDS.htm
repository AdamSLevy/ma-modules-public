<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Serial Data Source is a general purpose serial port reader. It is an event driven data source.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The <b>read timeout</b> specifies the receive timeout of the serial port. <b>use terminator</b>
toggles between two modes for matching input. Not using a terminator results in regex matching of 
the points' <i>value regex</i> directly. as opposed to a basic string compare when specifying a <b>message 
terminator</b>. Once the terminator is discovered, the <b>message regex</b> is applied, the group indexed 
at the <b>Point Identifier Index</b> is checked against points' <i>point identifiers</i>, and potentially 
searched for a new value.</p>

<p>If not using a teriminator, know that the implementation is greedy in its match attempts for points, 
and will pop characters equal to the first match's length and continue looking after. The order of consumption
for multiple matches should presently be considered undefined. Using a terminator is faster when possible.</p>
