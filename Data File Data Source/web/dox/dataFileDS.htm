<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Data File Data Source is intended to poll a particular directory for files, and either adds the parsed points
to itself as Mango data points or uses it to map the file's identifiers to other points within Mango. Currently, the 
data source is ready to accept XML, CSV, and Excel documents after some custom coding, explained in the related links.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<ul><li><b>File Type</b> selects between XML, CSV and Excel document types</li>
<li>If <b>CreatePoints</b> is checked, the data source will create data points assigned to itself with the XID from the imported file.</li>
<li><b>Data File Path</b> is the location the data source will search for import files. If the path is to a directory, the data source will 
	attempt to import all files within the directory, but will not recursively search the directory tree.</li>
<li>The <b>Template</b> is the name of the .class file in the directory associated with the file type. It does not need the .class appended!
	These are the customized importers for particular data files.</li>
<li><b>Delete After Import</b> determines if the imported file ought be deleted or renamed after the import is complete.</li>
<li>The <b>Imported Prefix</b> is what will be prepended to renamed files after import</li></ul>
